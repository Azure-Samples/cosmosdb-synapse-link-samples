        "This notebook scenario is [Microsoft Surface](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface) sales forecasting, with artificially created data. The business challenge is a **distributor that wants to predict how many units are necessary in the local warehouse to supply the stores in the area.**\n",

        "We will use Quantitative Models to forecast future data as a function of past data. They are appropriate to use when past numerical data is available and when it is reasonable to assume that some of the patterns in the data are expected to continue into the future. These methods are usually applied to short or intermediate range decisions. For more information, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting).\n",

Using the **Data / Linked** tab of your Synapse workspace, one of the pre-requisites mentioned in the README file, create a **RetailData** folder within the root directory of your storage account. Upload to this folder the csv files that are placed within the folder with the same name of this repo.

Using the Azure Portal, go to [Data Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/data-explorer) of your the Azure Cosmos DB Account and create a database called **RetailSalesDemoDB**. Change the Throughput to Autoscale and set the limit to 40,000 instead of 400, this will speed-up the loading process of the data, scaling down the database when it is not in use.
